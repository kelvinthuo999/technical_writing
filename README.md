## Grammar
### Just enough grammar

- Conjuction: a word that connects two nouns or phrases within a sentence.
- Transition: a word or phrase that connects two sentences.

### Words
- Recognize new or unfamiliar terms to the audience and define them.
- For definition of many terms, collect them into a glossary.
- Stick to one term throughout the document. Avoid renaming things.
- Spell out unfamiliar acronym and the put the acronym in parentheses. Both should be in bold.
- If an acronym is used a few times, don't define it.
- An acronym should only be defined only if: 
	1. It is significantly shorter than the full term.
	2. Appears many times in the document.
- Avoid pronouns by all means. 
- If you have to use pronouns, do the following:
	1. use the pronoun after introducing the noun.
	2. place the pronoun as close as possible to the referring noun.
	3. in case of a second pronoun, use the noun instead of the pronoun.

### Active voice

- Sentences in technical writing should be in active voice.
- An actor acts on the target in active voice.
- Here is a simple formula for sentences that follow active voice:
	Active Voice = actor + verb + target.
- In passive voice, the target is acted upon by the actor.
- A general formula for passive voice sentences:
	Passive Voice = target + verb + actor.
- Passive verbs have the formula:
	passive verb = form of be + past participle verb
- form of be is typically one of the following words: 
	- is/are
	- was/ were
- Past participle verb is a verb plus suffix ed. Although, some past participle are irregular like sat, known, frozen.
- An imperative verb is a command.
- Sentences that start with imperative verbs are typically in active voice.
- The main takeaway point is that technical documents are written in active voice to enhance clarity.

### Clear sentences

- Technical writers aim to be clear.
- Choosing precise, strong, specific verbs may take time but produces more satisfying results.
- Strong verbs ignites more engaging sentences.
- Reduce use of 'there is'/ 'there are' by providing a real object and a real verb.
- Placing numerical information in places of verbs add more credibility and accuracy to the statement.
- Key takeaway in this chapter include having stronger be verbs which require alot of research.

### Short sentences

- Short sentences have the following benefits:
	- Reads faster than longer documentation.
	- Typically easier to maintain than longer documentation.
	- Reduces points of failure.
	- Easier to understand.
- One key way to reduce long sentences is converting them into lists.
- Practice alot to eliminate or reduce extraneous word that are meaningless to the consumer.
- A clause is an independent logical fragment of a sentence that contains an actor and an action.
- Reduce subordinate clauses.
- Reserve 'which' for nonessential subordinate clauses and use 'that' for an essential subordinate clause.
- Place a comma before 'which'; do not place a comma before 'that'.
- Key takeaway from this lesson is to create short sentences, introduce lists where necessary, and, finally, 
  reduce subordinate clauses.
